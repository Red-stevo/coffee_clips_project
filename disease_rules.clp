    providing an ideal environment for the development and 
    spread of root rot pathogens.

    Fungal pathogens: 
    Various species of fungi, including Phytophthora, Fusarium, 
    and Pythium, are major contributors to the development of 
    root rot. 
    These pathogens infect the roots, leading to their decay 
    and eventual death of the plant.

    Soil compaction: 
    Compacted soils restrict the movement of air and water, 
    leading to poor aeration and drainage, which can 
    predispose plants to root rot.

Symptoms:
---------
    Wilting and yellowing of leaves.
    Stunted growth and reduced vigor.
    Root discoloration and decay.
    Abnormal root growth, such as slimy or discolored roots.
    Plant death in severe cases.

Treatment and Prevention:
--------------------------
